# How can we make flood data more useful?
![project image: flood warning and maps](project_image.png)

This repository contains flood risk maps made with [folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/), for use in the [Brigstow](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/brigstow/)-funded seed corn project["How can flood data be more useful?"](https://brigstowinstitute.blogs.bristol.ac.uk/project/how-can-flood-data-be-more-useful/).

These maps are part of a survey of NGOs and government departments who use flood data in order to help physical scientists present it to them in the most useful way.
